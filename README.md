# Platformer
A basic platformer feel free to look at the code


## What you can do and can't do with the code
Can:
 - Look inside of the codebase
 - Use the code in your own projects
 - Modify it

Can't:
 - Claim it as your own 
 - Use a diffrent license


## Personal project
So just some remarks: 
 - It's a project for me to understand of how to make more complicated systems within a game.
 - It will probably include bad code practices
 - It will probably include bad resource management
 - A weird code-style
 - It's just for fun
